# High-Dimensional-Classification
Results of different Machine Learning models on a high dimensional classification task. <br\ >

All scripts run on python3.<br\ >

The following packages were used extensively:<br\ >
scikit-learn<br\ >
keras<br\ >
numpy<br\><br\ >
pandas<br\ >
fancyimpute<br\ >
The dependencies can be installed by: <br\ >
`pip install -U scikit-learn
sudo pip install keras
sudo pip install numpy
pip install pandas fancyimpute`

For clarification,<br\>
Homogenous -> 1 type of classifier used (in ensemble or alone)<br\ >
Heterogenous -> many types of classifiers used in ensemble<br\ >
Neural Networks -> various configurations of artificial neural networks<br\ >
