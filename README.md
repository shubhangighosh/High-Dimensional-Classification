# High-Dimensional-Classification
Results of different Machine Learning models on a high dimensional classification task

Some of these codes run on python, while the rest run on python3

The following packages were used extensively:
scikit-learn
keras
numpy
pandas
fancyimpute
So they must be installed in order to run the code.

For clarification,
Homogenous -> 1 type of classifier used (in ensemble or alone)
Heterogenous -> many types of classifiers used in ensemble
Neural Networks -> various configurations of artificial neural networks
