# High-Dimensional-Classification
Results of different Machine Learning models on a high dimensional classification task.  
This is a classification problem of 29 classes with 9501 training instances of 2600
dimensions. The evaluation metric is the mean F1-score.  
The results can be found [here](https://github.com/shubhangighosh/High-Dimensional-Classification/blob/master/Results.pdf)

All scripts run on python3.  

The following packages were used extensively:  
scikit-learn  
keras  
numpy  
pandas  
fancyimpute  
The dependencies can be installed by:  
`pip install -U scikit-learn 
sudo pip install keras 
sudo pip install numpy 
pip install pandas fancyimpute  `

For clarification,  
Homogenous -> 1 type of classifier used (in ensemble or alone)  
Heterogenous -> many types of classifiers used in ensemble  
Neural Networks -> various configurations of artificial neural networks
